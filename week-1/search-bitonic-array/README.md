Search in a bitonic array. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers. Write a program that, given a bitonic array of nn distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

Standard version: Use \sim 3 \lg n∼3lgn compares in the worst case.
Signing bonus: Use \sim 2 \lg n∼2lgn compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than \sim 2 \lg n∼2lgn compares in the worst case).
