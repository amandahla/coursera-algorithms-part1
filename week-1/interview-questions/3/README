Successor with delete. Given a set of nn integers S = \{ 0, 1, ... , n-1 \}S={0,1,...,n−1} and a sequence of requests of the following form:

Remove xx from SS
Find the successor of xx: the smallest yy in SS such that y \ge xy≥x.
design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
